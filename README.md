# 🕹️ Breakout Clone Game with Pygame 🎮
Welcome to the Breakout Clone Game! This is a classic brick-breaking game built using Pygame in Python, where you control a paddle to bounce the ball and destroy blocks.

## 🚀 Features
* Responsive Paddle: Move left and right to bounce the ball.
* Dynamic Blocks: Break all the blocks to win the game!
* Challenging Ball Physics: Watch out for the ball's unpredictable bounce!
* Colorful Graphics: Each block has a randomly generated color.
* Game Over and Win Conditions: The game ends when the ball touches the bottom or all blocks are destroyed.

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kdaniel06/pygame-breakout-clone.git
    cd pygame-breakout-clone
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
